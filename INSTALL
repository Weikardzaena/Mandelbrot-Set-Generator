This is a standalone application that does not use anything platform-specific,
so the compiled executables should just run on any machine.  As for building the
code, you can use any c++0x compatible compiler to build the executable.

The .exe is for Windows and the MandelbrotGenerator with no extension is the
executable for Unix-based machines.
