This is a command-line interactive application that generates the Mandelbrot Set
at user-specified locations in the complex plane at a given zoom level.  It's
fairly simple in it's execution, and I plan to make this into a GUI similar to
Fractal eXtreme (http://www.cygnus-software.com/).  The output is a raw bitmap
that is named according to the choice of coordinates.

Since this project doesn't use any platform-specific libraries (other than
c++0x) almost any C++ compiler will work for compiling this application.
